# country_holidays
## Country holidays per year in a simple format.
This file is intended to be used by anyone who needs to be able to list all holidays with corresponding dates for a specific country. An example could be to see if a future date is a banking day or not.

### Nice-to-knows
Currently, only Sweden (SE) is completely implemented.
country_holidays.py relies on date_utils.py to work.


### Prerequisites
pandas
datetime
date_utils.py (included in this repo)

### Contributing
Contribution is most welcome and wanted! I want to collaborate and learn to code python properly, anything I can learn is of interest.

Please contact [Alexander Nadjalin](https://github.com/AlexanderNadjalin) for the process of contributing. This is my first public repository and I'm unfamiliar with how contribution usually works.
